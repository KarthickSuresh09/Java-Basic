What is Collection?
In Java, Collections are used to store, retrieve, manipulate, and communicate aggregate data.
The Java Collection Framework provides a set of interfaces and classes to handle groups of objects efficiently.

  
🔰 1. Collection Framework Hierarchy
At the top is the java.util.Collection interface, which is extended by:
* List
* Set
* Queue
Then there's Map, which is not a part of the Collection interface but is still part of the framework.

  
🔹 2. List Interface
> Ordered collection
> Allows duplicates
> Index-based access

Common Classes:
* ArrayList – resizable array, fast for read
* LinkedList – doubly linked list, fast for insert/delete
* Vector – synchronized version of ArrayList
* Stack – subclass of Vector (LIFO)



🔹 3. Set Interface
> Unordered
> No duplicates

Common Classes:
* HashSet – uses hash table, fastest
* LinkedHashSet – maintains insertion order
* TreeSet – sorted order (uses TreeMap internally)



🔹 4. Queue Interface
> FIFO (First-In-First-Out)
> Used for processing tasks

Common Classes:
* PriorityQueue – elements processed based on priority
* ArrayDeque – double-ended queue


🔹 5. Map Interface
> Stores key-value pairs
> No duplicate keys

Common Classes:
* HashMap – no order
* LinkedHashMap – insertion order
* TreeMap – sorted by keys
* Hashtable – synchronized


  🔍 Summary Table:

| Interface | Implementation | Features                 |
| --------- | -------------- | ------------------------ |
| List      | ArrayList      | Ordered, duplicates      |
| Set       | HashSet        | Unordered, no duplicates |
| Queue     | LinkedList     | FIFO                     |
| Map       | HashMap        | Key-value pairs          |
